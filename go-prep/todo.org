#+title: Todo
- Function to determine what number the current xkcd is
  - num property in JSON found at =xkcd.com/info.0.json=
- Get all json objects from 1 to current and save to json file
  - Bonus: check if file already exists and append as necessary if so
- Call all URL's
  - Make it parallel
  - ~make~ a slice and make its length however many xkcd's
  - call in GoChannel and make the correct space in the slice equal to the correct xkcd
  - should they all be strings?
  - Make it a JSON array and write to file
- Make search work
  - How should search be implemented?
  - SQLite?
  - Probably easier just to use the text file
- Print url and transcript
